## 👨‍💻 About This Track
This repository contains a day-by-day guide to mastering the art of Penetration Testing. It focuses on the "Practical" side of hacking—moving beyond theory to actual tools, techniques, and methodologies used by industry professionals.

### Why This Roadmap?
* **Structured Learning:** No more "what do I learn next?"—every day has a specific goal.
* **Tool Mastery:** Hands-on experience with Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and more.
* **Methodology Focused:** Teaches the full PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) lifecycle.

## 📂 The 30-Day Roadmap

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Enumeration (Days 1-10)
* **Active & Passive Recon:** OSINT, Google Dorking, and WHOIS.
* **Scanning:** Master Nmap, service identification, and vulnerability scanning.
* **Web Enumeration:** Directory brute-forcing and hidden file discovery.

### Phase 2: Exploitation & Vulnerabilities (Days 11-20)
* **Web Attacks:** SQL Injection, XSS, and IDOR.
* **Network Attacks:** Exploiting SMB, FTP, and SSH vulnerabilities.
* **Metasploit Framework:** Payload generation and listener configuration.

### Phase 3: Post-Exploitation & Reporting (Days 21-30)
* **Privilege Escalation:** Moving from user to root/admin in Linux and Windows.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Safely moving data out of a target network.
* **Reporting:** How to document findings for a professional client.
